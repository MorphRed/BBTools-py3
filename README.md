This python script needs the astor package to work <br/>
do ```pip install astor``` in the command line/powershell

Based on https://github.com/dantarion/bbtools, this version updates the code to python 3 along with astor. Moreover, indentation errors are automatically fixed when parsing in order to prevent previously infamous asterrors.
